Requirements

    Node.js 22+ and npm

Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Boilerplate.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name
npm install

For your information, all dependencies are updated every month.

Then, you can run the project locally in development mode with live reload by executing:

npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project. For your information, the project is already pre-configured with a local database using PGlite. No extra setup is required to run the project locally.
Set up authentication

To get started, you will need to create a Clerk account at Clerk.com and create a new application in the Clerk Dashboard. Once you have done that, copy the NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY values and add them to the .env.local file (not tracked by Git):

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_pub_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key

Now you have a fully functional authentication system with Next.js, including features such as sign up, sign in, sign out, forgot password, reset password, update profile, update password, update email, delete account, and more.
Set up remote database

The project uses DrizzleORM, a type-safe ORM that is compatible with PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MySQL databases. By default, the project is configured to seamlessly work with PostgreSQL, and you have the flexibility to choose any PostgreSQL database provider of your choice.

To set up a remote and production database, you need to create a PostgreSQL database and obtain the connection string. One recommended option is to use Prisma PostgreSQL, which provides a free PostgreSQL database. This database is compatible and has been tested with Next.js Boilerplate.

After creating your Prisma account, you can get the connection string in the Connect to your database section and select the Any client tab. Then, you can generate the connection string by clicking the Generate database credentials button. Finally, you can copy the connection string and add the DATABASE_URL variable to the .env.local file.
Translation (i18n) setup

For translation, the project uses next-intl combined with Crowdin. As a developer, you only need to take care of the English (or another default language) version. Translations for other languages are automatically generated and handled by Crowdin. You can use Crowdin to collaborate with your translation team or translate the messages yourself with the help of machine translation.

To set up translation (i18n), create an account at Crowdin.com and create a new project. In the newly created project, you will be able to find the project ID. You will also need to create a new Personal Access Token by going to Account Settings > API. Then, in your GitHub Actions, you need to define the following environment variables: CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID and CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN.

After defining the environment variables in your GitHub Actions, your localization files will be synchronized with Crowdin every time you push a new commit to the main branch.

Customization

You can easily configure Next js Boilerplate by searching the entire project for FIXME: to make quick customizations. Here are some of the most important files to customize:

    public/apple-touch-icon.png, public/favicon.ico, public/favicon-16x16.png and public/favicon-32x32.png: your website favicon
    src/utils/AppConfig.ts: configuration file
    src/templates/BaseTemplate.tsx: default theme
    next.config.ts: Next.js configuration
    .env: default environment variables

You have full access to the source code for further customization. The provided code is just an example to help you start your project. The sky's the limit 🚀.
Change database schema

To modify the database schema in the project, you can update the schema file located at ./src/models/Schema.ts. This file defines the structure of your database tables using the Drizzle ORM library.

After making changes to the schema, generate a migration by running the following command:

npm run db:generate

This will create a migration file that reflects your schema changes. The migration is automatically applied during the next database interaction, so there is no need to run it manually or restart the Next.js server.
Commit Message Format

The project follows the Conventional Commits specification, meaning all commit messages must be formatted accordingly. To help you write commit messages, the project uses Commitizen, an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

npm run commit

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is the ability to automatically generate a CHANGELOG file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.
CodeRabbit AI Code Reviews

The project uses CodeRabbit, an AI-powered code reviewer. CodeRabbit monitors your repository and automatically provides intelligent code reviews on all new pull requests using its powerful AI engine.

Setting up CodeRabbit is simple, visit coderabbit.ai, sign in with your GitHub account, and add your repository from the dashboard. That's it!
Testing

All unit tests are located alongside the source code in the same directory, making them easier to find. The project uses Vitest and React Testing Library for unit testing. You can run the tests with the following command:

npm run test

Integration & E2E Testing

The project uses Playwright for integration and end-to-end (E2E) testing. You can run the tests with the following commands:

npx playwright install # Only for the first time in a new environment
npm run test:e2e

Deploy to production

During the build process, database migrations are automatically executed, so there's no need to run them manually. However, you must define DATABASE_URL in your environment variables.

Then, you can generate a production build with:

$ npm run build

It generates an optimized production build of the boilerplate. To test the generated build, run:

$ npm run start

You also need to defined the environment variables CLERK_SECRET_KEY using your own key.

This command starts a local server using the production build. You can now open http://localhost:3000 in your preferred browser to see the result.
Deploy to Sevalla

You can deploy a Next.js application along with its database on a single platform. First, create an account on Sevalla.

After registration, you will be redirected to the dashboard. From there, navigate to Database > Create a database. Select PostgreSQL and and use the default settings for a quick setup. For advanced users, you can customize the database location and resource size. Finally, click on Create to complete the process.

Once the database is created and ready, return to the dashboard and click Application > Create an App. After connecting your GitHub account, select the repository you want to deploy. Keep the default settings for the remaining options, then click Create.

Next, connect your database to your application by going to Networking > Connected services > Add connection and select the database you just created. You also need to enable the Add environment variables to the application option, and rename DB_URL to DATABASE_URL. Then, click Add connection.

Go to Environment variables > Add environment variable, and define the environment variables NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY from your Clerk account. Click Save.

Finally, initiate a new deployment by clicking Overview > Latest deployments > Deploy now. If everything is set up correctly, your application will be deployed successfully with a working database.
Error Monitoring

The project uses Sentry to monitor errors. In the development environment, no additional setup is needed: Next.js Boilerplate is pre-configured to use Sentry and Spotlight (Sentry for Development). All errors will automatically be sent to your local Spotlight instance, allowing you to experience Sentry locally.

For production environment, you'll need to create a Sentry account and a new project. Then, in next.config.mjs, you need to update the org and project attributes in withSentryConfig function. Additionally, add your Sentry DSN to sentry.client.config.ts, sentry.edge.config.ts and sentry.server.config.ts.
Code coverage

Next.js Boilerplate relies on Codecov for code coverage reporting solution. To enable Codecov, create a Codecov account and connect it to your GitHub account. Your repositories should appear on your Codecov dashboard. Select the desired repository and copy the token. In GitHub Actions, define the CODECOV_TOKEN environment variable and paste the token.

Make sure to create CODECOV_TOKEN as a GitHub Actions secret, do not paste it directly into your source code.
Logging

The project uses Pino.js for logging. In the development environment, logs are displayed in the console by default.

For production, the project is already integrated with Better Stack to manage and query your logs using SQL. To use Better Stack, you need to create a Better Stack account and create a new source: go to your Better Stack Logs Dashboard > Sources > Connect source. Then, you need to give a name to your source and select Node.js as the platform.

After creating the source, you will be able to view and copy your source token. In your environment variables, paste the token into the LOGTAIL_SOURCE_TOKEN variable. Now, all logs will automatically be sent to and ingested by Better Stack.
Checkly monitoring

The project uses Checkly to ensure that your production environment is always up and running. At regular intervals, Checkly runs the tests ending with *.check.e2e.ts extension and notifies you if any of the tests fail. Additionally, you have the flexibility to execute tests from multiple locations to ensure that your application is available worldwide.

To use Checkly, you must first create an account on their website. After creating an account, generate a new API key in the Checkly Dashboard and set the CHECKLY_API_KEY environment variable in GitHub Actions. Additionally, you will need to define the CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID, which can also be found in your Checkly Dashboard under User Settings > General.

To complete the setup, update the checkly.config.ts file with your own email address and production URL.
Arcjet security and bot protection

The project uses Arcjet, a security as code product that includes several features that can be used individually or combined to provide defense in depth for your site.

To set up Arcjet, create a free account and get your API key. Then add it to the ARCJET_KEY environment variable.

Arcjet is configured with two main features: bot detection and the Arcjet Shield WAF:

    Bot detection is configured to allow search engines, preview link generators e.g. Slack and Twitter previews, and to allow common uptime monitoring services. All other bots, such as scrapers and AI crawlers, will be blocked. You can configure additional bot types to allow or block.
    Arcjet Shield WAF will detect and block common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

Arcjet is configured with a central client at src/libs/Arcjet.ts that includes the Shield WAF rules. Additional rules are applied when Arcjet is called in middleware.ts.
Useful commands
Bundle Analyzer

Next.js Boilerplate includes a built-in bundle analyzer. It can be used to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles. To begin, run the following command:

npm run build-stats

By running the command, it'll automatically open a new browser window with the results.
Database Studio

The project is already configured with Drizzle Studio to explore the database. You can run the following command to open the database studio:

npm run db:studio

Then, you can open https://local.drizzle.studio with your favorite browser to explore your database.
VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode user, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in .vscode/extension.json. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed in your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and display errors. The same applies to testing: you can install the VSCode Vitest extension to automatically run your tests, and it also shows the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide-type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with Cmd + Shift + B on Mac.
